		<h1>Trackmania Colour Utility</h1>
		<p>
			I'll get some nice styling on this at some point but I wanted to quickly explain the
			purpose of this utility, as well as how to use it.
		</p>
		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>
			The Trackmania Colour Utility provides an easy-to-use, simple way of filling any and all
			map signs with a solid colour for any possible hexadecimal code available. This should
			be a quicker, easier way of doing it than, say, making the image in Photoshop, uploading
			the image somewhere and then linking to <em>that</em> image from within the game's map
			editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead, you can now just paste in a link similar to the ones below, and instantly
			texture your signs with whatever colour you want!
		</p>
		<h2>How to use</h2>
		<p>
			This utility works by reading a hexadecimal code that you pass in via the URL (the text
			at the top of your browser). I think some examples might work better than me trying to
			explain it with words:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Red:
				<a href="https://trackmania-colour.herokuapp.com/ff0000.png"
					><code>https://trackmania-colour.herokuapp.com/ff0000.png</code></a
				>
			</li>
			<li>
				Green:
				<a href="https://trackmania-colour.herokuapp.com/00ff00.png"
					><code>https://trackmania-colour.herokuapp.com/00ff00.png</code></a
				>
			</li>
			<li>
				Blue:
				<a href="https://trackmania-colour.herokuapp.com/0000ff.png"
					><code>https://trackmania-colour.herokuapp.com/0000ff.png</code></a
				>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Each of those links should take you to a page displaying a 1x1 pixel image, in the
			colour specified by the hexcode (those six letters/numbers) just before the
			<code>.png</code> in the URL.
